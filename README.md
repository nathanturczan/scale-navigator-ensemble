# Scale Navigator Dashboard 
### (previously called scale navigator ensemble. Also thinking about re-naming to "Scale Navigator Web")
## to-do list 7-22-2021

- [ ] Re-factor everything. I think we should use React -- this will make it easier to port to mobile.
- [ ] I think index.html can be left alone for now -- doesn't need refactoring???
- [ ] sketch.js needs a complete overhaul. Some priorities:
  - responsive / mobile first design.
    - logo is size responsive, also changes color according to current scale
  - dealing with mouse clicks VS touchscreens
  - integrating Ondrej's new animated interface
  - autopilot (chooses a random scale from the list of adjescent scales every X seconds. Perhaps a slider for user to control rate of change??)
  - communication to Firebase database 
    - creating chatrooms (or "ensemble")
    - updating who is host 
    - and updating "current scale" for given chatroom
  - MIDI
    - sending MIDI data (such as root, notes, chords, etc) to local ports with Web MIDI API
  - Scale Network Visualization
  - tablature
    - render musical notation
    - render instrument tabs
    - render possible triads (chords) to play
